# C++ Shell
## A Novelty shell for humans, by a human.

C++ Shell (C++S/CPPS) is a work in progress custom shell, designed to be completely cross platform.
This is my first project written with any C++ code whatsoever, so expect some bugs that need to be fixed!

This shell is inspired by Nushell, which is the shell I personally use.

This is just a project for fun, it is not intended for serious use.

## Features
- STDOUT and STDERR of the programs being ran are piped into the STDOUT and STDERR of the shell.
- Three built in commands. Clear, Time/Date & Exit.
